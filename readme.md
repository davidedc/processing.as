What?
=====

A Flash applet that interprets and renders a processing program.

Why?
====
It's a way to run Processing programs in browsers which don't support the Canvas element. It's currently used by the sketchPatch.net site.


History
====
Processing.as is a project started by Tim Cameron Ryan. Several changes were made by me, while in the meantime Tim moved on to CrossProcessing (which uses Haxe). So it's an unfortunate case of divorced frameworks where valuable work has been done on both "branches", but hey such is life.
CrossProcessing has the advantage of supporting whatever target supported by Haxe (i.e. flash, browsers with Canvas, even Android and iPhone native Apps).
